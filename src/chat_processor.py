    This is a focused, defensive cleanup for the *final* web-search query
    selected in ``build_context_preface`` (issue #4547): regardless of whether
    the query came from the LLM-generated path (#4557) or the first-line
    fallback, residual fenced / inline markdown should not leak into the search
    call. Rather than using regex (which is brittle and strips inline code
    text like ``git reset`` from the query), we render the query to HTML via
    ``markdown`` and parse it with ``BeautifulSoup`` so that:

    * ``<pre>`` blocks (fenced / indented code) are removed entirely.
    * ``<code>`` elements (inline code) are preserved as plain text.

    Both libraries are already project dependencies. The result is whitespace
    collapsed and truncated to ``max_len``; an all-code input collapses to an
    empty string, which the caller treats as "no query".
