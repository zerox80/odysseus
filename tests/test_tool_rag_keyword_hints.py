"""Regression for issue #1707 — the agent tool-RAG force-included the entire
email toolset on any "tell me ..." query, crowding out the relevant tools so the
model believed it only had email tools and refused web/other tasks.

Root cause: `_KEYWORD_HINTS` in src/tool_index.py listed "tell" under the email
intent, and `get_tools_for_query` force-includes a hint's tools whenever any of
its keywords appears (word-boundary match). "tell" appears in a huge fraction of
requests (the reporter's was "visit <url> and tell me the title"), so email tools
were force-included for non-email queries.

These hints are deterministic string matching — no embeddings — so we can test
`get_tools_for_query` directly with retrieval stubbed out (no ChromaDB needed).
