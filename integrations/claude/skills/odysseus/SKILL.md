# Odysseus

Use this skill when a user asks to interact with Odysseus from Claude Code.

## Configuration

Expect these environment variables:

- `ODYSSEUS_URL`: Base URL for the user's Odysseus instance, for example `http://127.0.0.1:7000`.
- `ODYSSEUS_API_TOKEN`: Scoped API token created in Odysseus Settings > Integrations > Add Integration > Claude Agent.

If either value is missing, do not guess credentials. Tell the user to create a Claude Agent token in Odysseus Settings and expose both values to the terminal session.

## When to use what

- **Reminder ("remind me at 5pm to do X")** → TODO with `due_date`. The due_date IS the reminder — it fires a notification automatically via the user's configured channel (browser/email/ntfy). **Do NOT create a calendar event for a reminder.** Creating a calendar event named "Reminder" does NOT trigger a notification — it's just a time block on the calendar.
- **Calendar event ("meeting at 3pm", "dentist Tuesday 10am")** → calendar event. Use for scheduled time blocks, meetings, appointments, recurring schedules. These show up on the calendar grid; reminders for them are configured separately in Odysseus settings.
- **Note / freeform info ("note that the wifi password is ...")** → memory or todo without a due_date (depending on whether it's a fact about the user or an action item).
- **Persistent fact / preference about the user** → memory.

If the user says "reminder" + a time, default to TODO with due_date. Only switch to calendar if the user explicitly says "calendar", "event", "meeting", "appointment", or describes a time *range*.

## Safety

- All Odysseus data access MUST go through the scoped HTTP API under `/api/codex/*` (the canonical scope-gated agent API, shared by all agent integrations).
- Check `/api/codex/capabilities` before using a tool surface.
- Treat `403` as an intentional Settings restriction. Do not work around it.
- Do not use SSH, Docker, direct Python imports, SQLite queries, MCP internals, browser cookies, or local files to read/write Odysseus user data.
- Do not call helpers like `do_manage_notes`, email MCP internals, or database sessions directly for user data, even if shell access exists.
- Never send email directly unless the user explicitly asks to send and the token has a send-capable scope.
- Keep actions scoped to the token owner.

## Todos

The scoped agent API supports todos/checklists:

- `GET /api/codex/todos`
- `POST /api/codex/todos`

Use the bundled helper script when available:

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/odysseus/scripts/odysseus_api.py capabilities
python3 ~/.claude/skills/odysseus/scripts/odysseus_api.py todos list
python3 ~/.claude/skills/odysseus/scripts/odysseus_api.py todos add "Follow up"
```

Supported todo actions are `list`, `add`, `update`, `delete`, and `toggle_item`.

**Reminders (todos with a due date)** — the backend parses natural language. Send `due_date` in the body via the generic POST so the time becomes a structured reminder, NOT a literal substring inside the title. The `todos add TITLE` shortcut only sets the title, so use the POST form for anything with a time:

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/odysseus/scripts/odysseus_api.py POST /api/codex/todos '{"action":"add","title":"Call dentist","due_date":"tomorrow at 5pm"}'
```

The backend accepts both ISO timestamps and natural language like `"tomorrow 5pm"`, `"next Monday 9am"`, `"in 2 hours"`. It anchors to the user's timezone.

## Email

The scoped agent API supports email reads:

- `GET /api/codex/emails?folder=INBOX&limit=10&offset=0&filter=all`
- `GET /api/codex/emails/{uid}?folder=INBOX`

Use the bundled helper script when available:

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/odysseus/scripts/odysseus_api.py emails list 5
python3 ~/.claude/skills/odysseus/scripts/odysseus_api.py emails read UID
```

If `/api/codex/capabilities` does not show `email.read: true`, do not inspect email. Ask the user to enable Email read in the Claude Agent settings.

## Memory

- `GET /api/codex/memory` — list memories for the token owner.
- `POST /api/codex/memory` — body `{"text": "...", "category": "fact", "source": "user", "session_id": null}`. Requires `memory:write`.
- `DELETE /api/codex/memory/{memory_id}` — remove a memory entry. Requires `memory:write`.

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/odysseus/scripts/odysseus_api.py GET /api/codex/memory
python3 ~/.claude/skills/odysseus/scripts/odysseus_api.py POST /api/codex/memory '{"text":"User prefers SI units","category":"preference"}'
```

## Calendar

- `GET /api/codex/calendar/events?start=ISO&end=ISO` — list events in window.
- `POST /api/codex/calendar/events` — body matches `EventCreate` (`summary`, `dtstart`, `dtend`, `all_day`, `description`, `location`, `calendar_href`, `rrule`, `color`). Requires `calendar:write`.
- `DELETE /api/codex/calendar/events/{uid}` — delete event by uid (the value returned in the POST response). Requires `calendar:write`.

## Documents

- `GET /api/codex/documents?search=...&limit=50` — paginated library.
- `GET /api/codex/documents/{doc_id}` — fetch one document.
- `POST /api/codex/documents` — body `{"session_id": "...", "title": "...", "content": "...", "language": "markdown"}`. Requires `documents:write`.
- `DELETE /api/codex/documents/{doc_id}` — delete a document. Requires `documents:write`.

## Email draft + send

- Prefer `POST /api/codex/emails/draft-document` for agent-written email replies. It creates an editable Odysseus Document with `language: "email"` and does not touch IMAP/send.
- `POST /api/codex/emails/draft` — body matches `SendEmailRequest` (`to`, `cc`, `bcc`, `subject`, `body`, `body_html`, `attachments`, `account_id`, `in_reply_to`, `references`). Requires `email:draft` (or `email:send`).
- `POST /api/codex/emails/send` — same body. Requires `email:send`. Never send without explicit user instruction.

## Cookbook serve (debug a failing model launch)

Host-process and SSH inspection/control below is HIGH-TRUST and disabled unless `ODYSSEUS_ENABLE_HIGH_TRUST_COOKBOOK=true` is set by a trusted administrator. Never bypass that setting with shell, SSH, tmux, or another endpoint.

The Cookbook surface lets you reproduce what a human would do in Odysseus → Cookbook: read which serves are running, tail their tmux output to see why they crashed, edit the launch command, relaunch, kill a stuck one. Use this when the user is debugging a model server that won't come up (compute-capability errors, OOM, missing kernels, wrong attention backend, etc.).

- `GET /api/codex/cookbook/tasks` — list active serve/download/install tasks (sessionId, type, status, repo_id, remoteHost, payload._cmd). Requires `cookbook:read`.
- `GET /api/codex/cookbook/servers` — list configured servers (name, host, port, env type + path, model dirs). Requires `cookbook:read`.
- `GET /api/codex/cookbook/cached?host=<NAME>` — HIGH-TRUST list of models already cached on the named server (HF cache + Ollama + extra modelDirs). Requires the opt-in above and `cookbook:read`.
- `GET /api/codex/cookbook/presets` — list saved serve presets (model + host + port + cmd). The user's saved preset usually has a working cmd — try `preset NAME` before composing your own. Requires `cookbook:read`.
- `GET /api/codex/cookbook/output/{session_id}?tail=400` — HIGH-TRUST read of the last N lines of the task's persistent log file (preferred) or tmux pane (fallback). Requires the opt-in above and `cookbook:read`.
- `POST /api/codex/cookbook/serve` — HIGH-TRUST launch of a serve task. Body matches `ServeRequest`; requires the opt-in above and `cookbook:launch`.
- `POST /api/codex/cookbook/preset/{name}` — HIGH-TRUST launch of a saved preset by name. Requires the opt-in above and `cookbook:launch`.
- `POST /api/codex/cookbook/adopt` — register an existing administrator-launched tmux session into Cookbook tracking. Body: `{ tmux_session, model, host?, port? }`. This is a high-trust operation and is disabled unless `ODYSSEUS_ENABLE_HIGH_TRUST_COOKBOOK=true`; without adoption, the session is invisible to the UI. Requires `cookbook:launch`.
- `POST /api/codex/cookbook/stop/{session_id}` — HIGH-TRUST stop of the tmux session. Requires the opt-in above and `cookbook:launch`.

```bash
# Survey what's running
python3 ~/.claude/skills/odysseus/scripts/odysseus_api.py cookbook tasks

# Tail the failing one (sessionId from `cookbook tasks`)
python3 ~/.claude/skills/odysseus/scripts/odysseus_api.py cookbook output serve-abc12345 400

# Stop the previous attempt before you try a new flag set
python3 ~/.claude/skills/odysseus/scripts/odysseus_api.py cookbook stop serve-abc12345

# Relaunch with new flags. cmd MUST begin with one of the allowlisted binaries.
python3 ~/.claude/skills/odysseus/scripts/odysseus_api.py cookbook serve \
  /mnt/HADES/models/Qwen3.5-397B-A17B-AWQ \
  "vllm serve /mnt/HADES/models/Qwen3.5-397B-A17B-AWQ --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 --tensor-parallel-size 8 --max-model-len 262144 --gpu-memory-utilization 0.90 --dtype auto --max-num-seqs 8 --trust-remote-code --enable-expert-parallel --enable-auto-tool-choice --tool-call-parser qwen3_coder --reasoning-parser qwen3" \
  pewds@192.168.1.12
```

**Debug loop pattern:** when a serve is failing, the productive sequence is

1. `cookbook tasks` → find the failing sessionId.
2. `cookbook output SID 600` → read the last 600 lines, find the actual root-cause line (often above the visible tail because tmux scrollback rolled — request a larger `tail` if the error references "above").
3. `cookbook stop SID` — kill the previous attempt before relaunching; two serves on the same `--port` collide.
4. `cookbook serve repo "new cmd"` — try the next variation. Wait ~20s, then `cookbook output` on the new sessionId.

**Hard limits this surface enforces:**
- `cookbook serve` cmd allowlist + shell-metacharacter rejection — you cannot run arbitrary shell, only model-server binaries.
- `cookbook stop` only targets task sessionIds matching `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+`.
- The agent CAN spawn GPU-pinning long-lived processes — always `cookbook stop` your previous attempt before relaunching, and check `cookbook tasks` for collisions on the same `--port` before launching.

## Forbidden Bypass Pattern

If you are about to reach the Odysseus host/container, import app internals, query the database, or call MCP helper modules directly, stop. Those paths bypass Odysseus Settings and token scopes. Ask the user to enable the relevant Claude Agent tool toggle instead.
