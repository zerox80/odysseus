# Threat Model

Odysseus is a **self-hosted AI workspace with privileged local access**. This document states the trust boundary so contributors can reason about security decisions without reading through the full auth and middleware stack.

## Trust Boundary

Odysseus is designed for **trusted users on a private network**, not public exposure. The README describes it as "treat it like an admin console" — that framing is accurate. A logged-in admin can execute shell commands, read and write files, send email, and control model serving. This is intentional. The threat model does not try to prevent admins from doing these things. It does try to prevent:

- Unauthenticated access
- Non-admins reaching admin-only capabilities
- The AI agent acting on instructions injected through untrusted content (web results, emails, fetched pages, memories)
- Internal services (ChromaDB, Ollama, SearXNG, etc.) being reachable from outside the host

Non-admin defaults are in `core/auth.py:DEFAULT_PRIVILEGES`. Tool enforcement is in `src/tool_security.py:NON_ADMIN_BLOCKED_TOOLS`. Any tool whose name starts with `mcp__` is also blocked for non-admins. Admins always get full access regardless of stored privilege values.

## Authentication

- **Sessions:** bcrypt passwords, 7-day session tokens stored atomically in `data/sessions.json` via `core/atomic_io.py`.
- **2FA:** TOTP with 8 single-use backup codes. Verified after password check, before session issuance.
- **Reserved usernames:** `internal-tool`, `api`, `demo`, `system` cannot be registered or renamed into. Defined in `core/auth.py:RESERVED_USERNAMES`.
  - `internal-tool` is security-critical: `core/middleware.py:require_admin` treats any request where `request.state.current_user == "internal-tool"` as the in-process tool loopback and grants admin unconditionally. A real account with that name would silently pass every `require_admin` check.
- **Orphan sessions:** `validate_token` re-checks that the user record still exists on every call. A deleted user's cookie is dropped on next request rather than continuing to authenticate.

## Internal Tool Loopback

Agent tool calls reach admin-gated HTTP routes over an in-process HTTP loopback. The mechanism:

1. At app startup, `core/middleware.py` generates a random `INTERNAL_TOOL_TOKEN` via `secrets.token_hex(32)`. It is never persisted and never sent to clients.
2. Loopback requests carry `X-Odysseus-Internal-Token: <token>` or have `request.state.current_user` already set to `"internal-tool"` by the auth middleware.
3. `require_admin` recognises either signal and grants access without checking the session user.

The agent may be running in a non-admin user's session, but tool dispatch first calls `src/tool_security.py:owner_is_admin_or_single_user` to verify the session owner is an admin before issuing any loopback call. Non-admin users cannot invoke admin tools even via the agent.

## Prompt-Injection Hardening

External content that reaches the LLM is treated as untrusted via `src/prompt_security.py`:

- `untrusted_context_message(label, content)` wraps the content in a `user`-role message with a header block instructing the model not to follow instructions inside it. Content goes in as data, not as a system instruction.
- `UNTRUSTED_CONTEXT_POLICY` is a system-prompt preamble that states the same policy at the top of every session where untrusted data may appear.

**Untrusted surfaces that must go through this wrapper:** web search results, fetched URLs, emails (read), saved memories, skill text, notes, and any tool output sourced from outside the server. Email-reply generation keeps its system prompt static and sends original mail, attachments, retrieval context, and style examples as individually labelled untrusted `user` messages. Injecting untrusted content directly into the system role is a security bug.

## Agent Command and Workspace Isolation

Model-controlled `bash` and `python` commands use `src/sandbox_executor.py` and
have **no app-host fallback**. The Docker deployment starts a separate
`tool-sandbox` service that starts only long enough to bind a root-owned
Unix-domain control socket and then drops to the dedicated unprivileged
executor identity. It is read-only, has no retained capabilities,
memory/CPU/PID/file rlimits, and `network_mode: none`. It has no published
port, Docker socket, SSH material, application-data mount, service network, or
egress route. Its sole writable mounts are the dedicated `/workspace` volume
shared with the confined agent file tools and the private socket directory; the
application sees the latter read-only and can connect but cannot replace its
endpoint.

`src/tool_execution.py` resolves agent file paths only under that workspace and
rejects sensitive paths, symlink escapes, and extra host roots. If the executor
is missing or rejects a command, the tool fails closed instead of launching a
host process. Native deployments therefore need a separately configured
executor for agent command tools; they do not regain host execution by default.

Explicit Cookbook/operations routes remain high-trust administrative features.
The optional `docker/host-docker.yml` overlay is the only supported way to
mount a host Docker socket, and the tool-sandbox service never receives that
mount. The executor API uses the private authenticated Unix socket rather than
an IP network, so a model-controlled command cannot pivot from the sandbox into
the application or other Compose services over Docker networking.

## Outbound URL and Upload Boundaries

- `/api/v1/chat` validates a configured public model endpoint, resolves its
  approved IP address, pins the connection to that address, and disables
  redirects. Existing sessions without the persisted outbound-URL policy fail
  closed instead of silently using an old unchecked endpoint.
- `UploadBodyLimitMiddleware` enforces per-route multipart byte caps while
  reading the ASGI body, before Starlette can spool it. Routes also use bounded
  multipart parser settings for fields/files/parts.

## Build Integrity

Docker base and service images are pinned by digest. The Docker CLI and the
patched Real-ESRGAN source archives are checksum-verified before extraction.
Committed Python lockfiles contain versions and SHA-256 hashes and Docker uses
`pip --require-hashes`; `.in` files are the reviewable upgrade inputs.

## Security Headers

`core/middleware.py:SecurityHeadersMiddleware` sets headers on every response:

- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` + `frame-ancestors 'none'` on all routes except tool-render iframes (which are sandboxed at the HTML level).
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` everywhere.
- **CSP:** nonce-based `script-src 'self' 'nonce-{nonce}' https://cdn.jsdelivr.net`. `style-src 'unsafe-inline'` is intentionally kept — `static/index.html` ships inline `<style>` blocks and JS modules set `style=""` attributes at runtime. Inline styles do not execute script so the risk is visual-only. Removing this requires templating the HTML files and auditing all JS-set style attributes.

## Known Gaps

These are open, acknowledged, and contributor help is welcome:

1. **Container isolation is not a VM boundary.** The executor removes the app
   process, host filesystem, socket, and egress paths from model-controlled
   commands, but it still depends on a patched container runtime/kernel. Keep
   Docker and the host OS maintained and do not treat a writable workspace as
   confidential.

2. **Explicit Cookbook host-management remains high trust.** It is disabled
   unless `ODYSSEUS_ENABLE_HIGH_TRUST_COOKBOOK=true` is set. An administrator
   who deliberately enables it can start local processes, run remote hardware
   probes, and control configured SSH targets; adding `docker/host-docker.yml`
   can additionally manage the host Docker daemon. These modes must only be
   enabled for trusted operators.

3. **Token scopes are coarse.** There is no way to grant a session a subset of the owning user's privileges. Companion/mobile tokens carry either `chat` or `admin` scope with no per-capability granularity.
