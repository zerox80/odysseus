Prefer a dedicated tool for reading, writing, or searching files; use python only for what no dedicated tool covers. Do not use for web lookup/search; use web_search or web_fetch when web tools are available.",

Use this instead of bash/curl/python/requests for web searches. NOT for 'research X' / 'do research on X' requests — those are deep-research jobs (use trigger_research). web_search = one query; trigger_research = a full researched report in the sidebar.",
    "web_fetch": "Fetch and read the text content of a specific URL/website the user names (e.g. 'check example.com', 'open this link'). Use when you have a concrete URL; for open-ended lookups use web_search instead.",

    "get_workspace": "Return the absolute path of the active workspace folder the user is working in. File tools are confined to it; the shell starts there but is not sandboxed. Call this first when the user refers to 'the project'/'the code'/'this folder' without giving a path, instead of asking them.",
    "write_file": "Write/create or fully rewrite a file ON DISK (source code, configs, project files). Use for new files or full rewrites — NOT create_document (editor panel) and NOT a bash heredoc.",
    "edit_file": "Edit an existing file ON DISK by exact string replacement (fix a bug, change a function). Shows a diff. The tool for changing files on disk — NOT edit_document (editor panel) and NOT bash sed/heredoc.",
    "create_document": "Create a new document in the editor panel. For code, articles, text content longer than 15 lines, unless an already-open document/email draft is the obvious target. If an email compose draft is open, edit that draft instead of creating another document.",

    "manage_memory": "Memory management: list, add, edit, delete, or search persistent memories. For facts about the USER (their name, preferences, where they live). NOT for info about ANOTHER person — addresses, phones, emails belonging to a contact go in manage_contact, not memory.",

Use this for ANY 'show/read/list/open my documents/docs/files/notes' request — never shell or curl.",

Use this when the task is genuinely ambiguous and the answer changes what you do next — pick between approaches, confirm an assumption, choose among options — instead of guessing. Provide a clear `question` and 2-6 `options` (each with a short `label`, optional `description`). Omit `multi`/keep it false unless the question explicitly permits choosing multiple options. Calling this ENDS your turn: the user sees clickable buttons and their choice arrives as your next message. Don't use it for things you can decide from context or sensible defaults, or for irreversible-action confirmation if a dedicated flow exists.",

After finishing a step call this with the full checklist and that step marked done; when the user asks to change the plan call it with the revised checklist. Always pass the COMPLETE markdown checklist (`- [ ]` / `- [x]`), not a diff. The user's docked plan window updates live. No effect when there is no active plan.",
    "ui_control": "Control the UI and toggle tools on/off. Use this to turn off / turn on / disable / enable individual tools and features: shell (bash), search (web), research, browser, documents, incognito. Open panels (documents library, gallery, email inbox, sessions, notes, memories/brain, skills, settings, cookbook) via `open_panel <name>`. Use `open_email_reply <uid> <folder> reply <body text>` (or structured body) to open an email reply draft document without sending. USE THIS whenever the user says to write/draft a reply or tells you what to say — opening an empty draft or sending immediately is wrong. Body can continue on subsequent lines for multi-line replies. Also switches between chat/agent modes, changes the current model, and applies/creates themes.",

    "list_emails": "List emails for a folder/account, newest first, including read messages by default. Shows subject, sender, date, UID, account, and AI summary. Check inbox, find emails needing replies. Supports account from list_email_accounts for Gmail/work/custom mailboxes. For last/latest/newest email, use max_results=1 and unread_only=false.",

    "reply_to_email": "SEND a reply email immediately by UID. Do not use for write/draft/open/start reply requests; use ui_control open_email_reply with body so the user can review. Only use when the user explicitly says to send now. For send requests, use the exact UID and account from latest read_email/list_emails output; never invent UID 1. Threads automatically with In-Reply-To/References, prefixes Re:, marks original as Answered.",

Args: action=list|add|update|delete, name, email, phones, address, uid (from list). For 'save this for <person>' / address pastes / phone numbers next to a name, this is the right tool — NOT manage_memory. Do NOT use for facts about the USER ('my name is X'); those are manage_memory.",
    "manage_notes": "Create and manage notes and checklists (Google Keep-style). ALWAYS use this for note/todo/checklist/reminder creation — NEVER hit /api/notes via app_api. Accepts natural-language `due_date` like 'tomorrow at 9am' or '11pm today' (parsed in the USER'S timezone). The due_date IS the reminder — it fires a notification at that time, so do NOT also create a calendar event for the same reminder. Set colors, labels, pin, archive. Do NOT use manage_memory for note content.",
    "manage_calendar": "Calendar event management: list, create, update, delete. Each event can carry a tag/category (event_type — work/personal/health/travel/meal/social/admin/other) and importance (low/normal/high/critical). Resolve today/tomorrow using the Current date and time context, then use ISO datetimes in the user's local wall time; supports all-day events. Use rrule only for explicit recurrence; for update_event pass rrule='' to remove repeats. For event reminders/alarms, pass reminder_minutes; this creates the Notes reminder, so do not also call manage_notes for the same reminder.",
    "download_model": "Download a HuggingFace model to a local or remote server. Specify repo_id (e.g. 'Qwen/Qwen3-8B'), optional server host, and optional include filter for specific files.",
    "serve_model": "Start serving a model with vLLM, SGLang, llama.cpp, Ollama, or Diffusers. cmd MUST start with the binary directly — e.g. `vllm serve /mnt/HADES/models/Qwen3.5-397B-A17B-AWQ --port 8003 --tensor-parallel-size 8 …`. NEVER prefix with `cd …`, `source …`, or chain with `&&`/`||` — those get rejected by the validator. The venv activation (env_prefix) and CUDA env are added automatically from the target host's saved settings. For image/inpainting/diffusion use python3 scripts/diffusion_server.py --model <repo> --port 8100. After launch, call list_served_models for readiness/errors and retry suggestions. If serve_model fails with 'Invalid characters in cmd', simplify to the bare binary + args.",
    "list_served_models": "List currently running model servers in the Cookbook — shows status (loading, ready, idle, error), model name, port, throughput, and serve failure diagnosis/retry suggestions. Use when the user asks 'what's running', 'show my cookbook', 'which models are up', 'what's serving'.",
    "stop_served_model": "Stop a running model server in the Cookbook by session ID or model name. Use when the user says 'kill my cookbook', 'stop the model', 'kill the serve', 'shut down vLLM', 'cancel the running model'.",
    "tail_serve_output": "Read the actual tmux stderr/traceback of a cookbook serve/download task. Use to debug WHY a task is `crashed`/`error` (compute_89 nvcc mismatch, OOM, missing kernels, wrong attention backend, etc.) so you can call serve_model with adjusted flags. Pass session_id from list_served_models; tail defaults to 300, bump if the error references 'see root cause above'.",
    "list_downloads": "List in-progress HuggingFace model downloads in the Cookbook. Shows model name, phase, percent, session ID. Use for 'what's downloading', 'show my downloads', 'check download progress'.",
    "cancel_download": "Cancel an in-progress model download by tmux session ID. Use for 'cancel the download', 'stop downloading X', 'kill the download'. Call list_downloads first to get the session_id.",
    "search_hf_models": "Search HuggingFace for models matching a query (e.g. 'qwen 8B', 'flux', 'llama-3 instruct'). Returns ranked repo IDs with sizes and download counts. Use for 'find a model', 'search huggingface for X', 'what models are there for Y'.",
    "list_cached_models": "List models already cached on disk locally or on a remote host. Accepts friendly Cookbook server names like ajax. Use for 'what models do I have', 'show cached models', 'is X downloaded', 'list my models'. Avoids re-downloading.",
    "list_serve_presets": "List saved Cookbook serve presets (templates with model+host+port+cmd). Always call this BEFORE serve_model when the user asks to launch a known model — they probably have a preset for it from the UI.",
    "serve_preset": "Launch a saved Cookbook serve preset by name. Reuses the exact tmux command + host the user already saved. Use for 'run stable diffusion 3.5', 'serve vllm-qwen', 'start the inpaint model' — preset-name matches the user's UI labels.",
    "adopt_served_model": "Register an existing tmux model server (one started manually or outside the cookbook flow) into Cookbook tracking AND add it as a chat endpoint. Use when the user (or a previous turn) launched something via ssh+tmux and now wants it visible in the UI, stoppable via stop_served_model, and usable in the model picker.",
    "list_cookbook_servers": "List the cookbook's configured servers (remote GPU boxes + local) and which is the current default. Use this BEFORE download_model/serve_model when the user didn't name a host — to decide where to run, or to ask the user which server when ambiguous. Downloads/serves default to the cookbook's selected server, NOT localhost.",
    "app_api": "Generic loopback to allowed Odysseus internal endpoints. Use this when the user wants something the UI can do but there's no named tool for it. Covers calendar, gallery, library/documents, memory, notes, tasks, settings, research, compare, cookbook GPUs/state — allowed UI buttons hit /api/* endpoints and you can hit them too. Sensitive auth/user/admin/shell paths and host-control Cookbook mutation routes are blocked; do NOT use app_api for shell commands, package installs, engine rebuilds, or PID signalling. Use named command tooling for shell commands. action='endpoints' with filter=<keyword> lists available endpoints. action='call' takes method+path+body. Hits same routes the UI uses — auth flows free. NOTE: themes are NOT an API endpoint — use the ui_control tool (create_theme / set_theme), not app_api. SESSIONS/CHATS: do NOT use app_api for these — GET /api/sessions returns EMPTY for tool calls (it's owner-filtered and tool calls authenticate as a different identity). EMAIL ACCOUNTS: do NOT use /api/email/accounts via app_api; use list_email_accounts, list_emails, and read_email instead. To list/rename/archive/delete/fork chats use the list_sessions and manage_session tools instead.",
    "edit_image": "Edit an image in the gallery: upscale (increase resolution), remove background (rembg), inpaint (fill selected area), or harmonize (blend edits). Specify image ID and action.",
    "trigger_research": "Start a deep research job on any topic — appears in the Deep Research sidebar, streams progress, produces a detailed report. Use for 'research X', 'look into Y', 'do deep research on Z', 'investigate'. NOT a scheduled task — it runs now and surfaces in the sidebar.",
    "manage_bg_jobs": "Inspect and control detached background `bash` jobs (the ones started with a `#!bg` marker). action='list' shows this chat's jobs (id/status/age/command); action='output' returns a job's captured output so far (check on a long-running job, or re-read a finished one); action='kill' stops a runaway job by id. Use for 'is the background job done', 'check on that job', 'show the build output', 'kill the background job', 'stop the bg task'. output/kill need a job_id from list.",
