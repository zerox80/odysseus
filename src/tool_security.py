# some tools are only XML-invocable (e.g. manage_notes, generate_image) and never

# tool from the subtraction and silently leave it enabled. This set is the static
# backstop for both: union it in so known mutators are always subtracted, and so a
# failed import still blocks them (fail closed, never open). Only mutators belong
# here — read-only tools are covered by the allowlist. Keep in sync when adding
